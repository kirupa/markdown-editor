# Checks the pointer shapes over a picture in the real running app.
#
# The pointer is set by AppKit from cursor rects in response to real mouse
# tracking, so it cannot be checked in a unit test. This seeds a throwaway
# document, launches the app on it, moves the real mouse over the picture and
# its corners, and identifies the pointer from the screen.
#
# The app is launched from a bundle whose identifier is deliberately different
# from the installed one (MDE_DEV_BUNDLE=1). Without that, macOS state
# restoration reopens whatever documents the installed copy had open, and this
# script would be clicking around inside somebody's real files.

# This script takes over the screen: it brings the app to the front and moves
# the real mouse. Run it only on an idle machine. It is opt-in for that reason
# — run it by accident while somebody is working and it clicks into their
# windows and steals focus mid-task.
if [ "${MDE_ALLOW_SCREEN_CONTROL:-}" != "1" ]; then
    cat <<'WHY'
This check drives the real mouse and brings the app to the front, so it needs
the machine to itself. Re-run it with:

    MDE_ALLOW_SCREEN_CONTROL=1 ./Scripts/run-image-cursor-checks.sh

The pointer rects themselves are checked without the screen by
`make check-image-layout`, which is what CI and everyday work should use.
WHY
    exit 0

# A locked screen is not a failing check, it is an unavailable one, and the
# difference matters: `screencapture -R` and `-l` both refuse behind the lock
# screen while full-screen capture keeps working, so the pointer checks come
# back as "could not capture the document window" and read exactly like a bug
# in the app. Say what is actually wrong instead.
if ioreg -n Root -d1 -a 2>/dev/null | grep -A1 CGSSessionScreenIsLocked | grep -q "<true/>"; then
    cat <<'WHY'
The screen is locked, so the pointer cannot be photographed. macOS refuses
region and window captures behind the lock screen while still allowing a
full-screen one, so this check would report a capture failure that looks like
an app bug.

Unlock the screen and run it again.
