/// The things this window's title bar does that it would not do on its own:
/// fill the screen when double-clicked, move when dragged, and name the file it
/// is showing — plus the size Zoom goes to, which is asked of the same delegate.
///
/// They are here together because they are the same click, asked about in the
/// same geometry, and splitting them across files would mean two event
/// monitors racing for the same mouse-down.
///
/// A double-click fills the screen rather than zooming: see `TitleBarFill`.
/// Zoom — the green button's, and Window ▸ Zoom — keeps its own meaning, the
/// best size for the content, which is what the rest of this comment is about.
///
/// macOS asks the window's delegate `windowWillUseStandardFrame(_:defaultFrame:)`
/// and, with no answer, offers the whole screen. That is the wrong answer here
/// twice over: it is far more window than a document column needs, and with the
/// comments open it does not follow the content at all — the rail is a fixed
/// width docked to the document, so "everything" is a specific number rather
/// than "as much as possible".
///
/// It also widens the window to that same number when it is first seen, and
/// when the comments open on one that was already there — the one thing the
/// green button could never do: zoom is something a reader has to ask for, and
/// a document whose comments squeeze the writing has already got it wrong by
/// the time they could. A new window mostly needs nothing here, because it
/// opens at `Layout.defaultWindowContentSize`; this covers the windows that
/// size does not reach — one restored at a narrower width, and one whose
/// comments open after it was narrowed, or its column widened, while they were
/// shut.
///
/// Attached as a modifier on the editor, which is the only place that knows the
/// column's current width and whether the comments are open.
