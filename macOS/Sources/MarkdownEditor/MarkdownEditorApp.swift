/// They differ in one line. On macOS 27 SwiftUI opens an untitled document
/// from inside its own `applicationDidFinishLaunching`, before the app
/// delegate is consulted and without calling
/// `applicationShouldOpenUntitledFile(_:)` or `applicationOpenUntitledFile(_:)`.
/// The welcome window (W-1) then never appeared, and launch spent about half a
/// second building an editor window nobody asked for. From macOS 15 a scene
/// can be told not to open anything at launch; a scene builder accepts
/// `if #available` only without an `else`, so the choice is made here rather
/// than inside `body`.
