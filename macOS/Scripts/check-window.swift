// Does a real document window contain the rail it is showing?
//
// The geometry is unit-tested — `EditorPaneGeometry` answers how wide a window
// has to be and how narrow it may be dragged, and none of that needs a screen.
// What those tests cannot see is the wiring: whether the answer reaches the
// window. The bug this check exists for lived entirely in that gap. Every
// number was right and nothing asked the window to use them, so a document
// opened at the view's minimum width with the critique rail laid out past the
// trailing edge — header visible, body text and "Run critique" button outside
// the window.
//
// So this builds the real `MarkdownEditorView`, puts it in a real `NSWindow`
// the size a fresh document window is born, and reads the frame back.
//
// The window is fully transparent and ordered to the back, because the person
// who owns this machine is usually using it. It cannot be placed off-screen
// instead: a window that intersects no display has no `screen`, and the screen
// is half of what is being tested.
//
// Built by Scripts/run-window-checks.sh against the real app sources.
